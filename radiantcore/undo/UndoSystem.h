/**
* greebo: The UndoSystem (interface: iundo.h) is maintaining two internal
* stacks of Operations (one for Undo, one for Redo), each containing a list
* of Undoables plus their snapshot data.
*
* The Undoables are responsible of submitting their data to the UndoSystem
* before their data is changed, not knowing which or whether an operation is 
* currently active. If there actually is an Undo Operation in the works,
* this system is handling all of the paperwork.
*
* On undo or redo, the Undoables are called to re-import the states
* as stored in their UndoMementos. When undoing operations, the Undoables
* themselves are again responsible for submitting their data to the UndoSystem
* such that it can record the changes and store them in the RedoStack.
*
* The RedoStack is discarded as soon as a new Undoable Operation is recorded
* and pushed to the UndoStack.
