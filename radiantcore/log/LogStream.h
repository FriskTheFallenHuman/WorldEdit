 * greebo: A LogStream is a specialised std::ostream making
 * use of a customised std::streambuf (LogStreamBuf). 
 *
 * Several application-wide LogStream instances exist, one for
 * each LogLevel. The underlying LogStreamBuf will write
 * all output to the LogWriter singleton, which in turn
 * dispatches the text to the various LogDevices.
 *
 * Application code needs to include the itextstream.h header
 * and use the rMessage(), rWarning() and rError() shortcuts
 * to stream data to the log.
