// Encapsulates the 2x3 matrix transforming world coordinates into texture space
// 
// greebo: A brief note on why just 6 defined matrix components are enough here: 
// Normally projecting 3D coordinates might require a full 4x4 matrix such that every 
// XYZ component can be contributing. But in idTech engines the vertices are preprocessed
// using an "axis base" transformation as first step, which is rotating the world such that 
// the Z direction is aligned with the "direction" of the projection.
// 
// The full path from XYZ to UV is therefore: T x AB x XYZ = UV
// 
// The final texture matrix can just ignore the Z component of every vertex and 
// transform the remaining, meaningful XY components of the vector using a homegeneous 
// 3x3 matrix transformation. (The third component of the vector is used as 
// the W coordinate and is set to 1, to make it translatable by tx and ty):
// 
//  | xx yx tx |   | x |   | u |
//  | xy yy ty | X | y | = | v |
//  | 0  0  1  |   | 1 |   | 1 |
// 
// Therefore only 6 compontents are really needed to define the matrix.
// The trick to rotate the world space such that it is "oriented" along a plane changed 
// over time, from what I gathered reading the engine code.
// Q3-type engines seemed to pick one of the 6 axis-aligned planes (picking the one matching
// the face normal the most), whereas Doom 3 goes a step further and aligns the Z axis 
// of the world system to the normal of the face plane. That's why the values of shift/scale/rotation
// texdef defined in a Q3 map file will never look the same in idTech4 engines when placed on
// angled brush faces - there will always be a stretch in some direction, which the D3 engine
// completely works around by using the actual face normal - no stretching.
